# Emoji-sama App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. This is an application created to introduce myself to different JavaScript frameworks and libraries which are helpful for me to gain knowledge and practice. 

# What is this app?

This application lets the user sign in, sign out, and view the posts and profiles of other users. I used the Clerk for authentication and login method, and PlanetScale for prisma database.  

## Demo
You can access the live demo of the application at [https://emoji-sama-4boqmcy5h-yowhobin.vercel.app/](https://emoji-sama-4boqmcy5h-yowhobin.vercel.app/)
